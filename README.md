## Documentation

### Swagger

Swagger documentation exists to show what the endpoints of the system will be, and how to interact with the endpoints. You can load the documentation into
a swagger instance for a client view. 

If you are running postman, you can import the swagger yaml to autopopulate a postman collection. This can speed up your development efforts on the short term.

TODO -- Add docker swagger viewer startup script to launch the documents locally
